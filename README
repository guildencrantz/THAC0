Somebody in your google+ stream too noisy? Still want to follow them, but only want to see things they've posted which have at least +1, or +5, or +100? This is the chrome extension for you.

Currently if you create a "+1" circle and add somebody to it the extension will hide all updates from that person which haven't been +1ed at least once. Likewise a +2 circle will only show you updates which have been +1ed by two people. You can use any threshold you like, just don't put any punctuation in the circle name (+1000, not +1,000 or +1.000). Simple. 

If you actually want to check in on people who you're filtering you can always go to their profile: the feed on that page won't be filtered. If you want to check in on everybody in a filtered circle you can go to the steam for that circle and the extension is smart enough not to filter it for you.

NOTE: If you place somebody in multiple filter circles only the most restrictive circle will be used (meaning if Bob is in both the +1 and +5 circles you'll only see his posts which have at least +5).

WARNING: This extension doesn't reorder updates. If an update is hidden at position #19 in your stream when it finally gets enough votes it'll simply become visible in position #19 rather than being moved up to position #1.
