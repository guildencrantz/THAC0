Somebody in your google+ stream too noisy? Still want to follow them, but only want to see things they've posted which have at least +1, or +5, or +100? This is the chrome extension for you.

Once you've installed the extension simply create new circles called "+1", "+5", or what ever number you want (no punctuation except the leading +). Now add the noisy people you want tamed to one of these circles and all updates that the people in those circles make will be hidden until they reach the number of plusses for the circle they are in. Note: If somebody is placed in multiple circles, such as both "+1" and "+5" the value of the larger circle, +5 in this case, is used. This means that you'll only see posts from this person once they've reached at least +5.
